- [**AllenNLP Hacks 2021 Prediction**](https://allennlp-hackathon.apps.allenai.org/)
  - Leveraged GPT-3 for text-simplification via prompt-engineering and improved via ranking multiple generated outputs in post-processing.
  - Devised a ranking model over GPT-3â€™s outputs as Bert Regression model trained for sorted-simple text first on scrapped ELI5 subreddit data.
  - Won the 1 st prize for well-designed user interface and system design, built on a well-motivated research plan.

## ðŸŽ¥ **Filmmaking & Animation**

I make films covering a variety of topics. I developed a short film to promote afforestation and placed second in the General Championship at IIT Kharagpur. I also try to simulate virtual Varanasi.

## **Architecture?**
Architecture is a love-hate relationship for me. Architecture, in my opinion, is a field that, at its core, is as bizarre as poetry or music, but has been relegated to the status of real estate make-up. I have no plans to pursue the field in the manner it is now practised, but I do see the importance of architectural design practise in all of my works. For my undergrad thesis (to be completed by July 2022), I am designing the '[AI Innovation and Accleration Center](https://www.canva.com/design/DAE-3aLHq7Y/kp8uawa_j22iV34nK21-MA/view)' that will encapsulate everything I've learned so far.

**Previous work**  
I've worked on a lot of studio design projects in the past.Â You can find some of my project in the link below
