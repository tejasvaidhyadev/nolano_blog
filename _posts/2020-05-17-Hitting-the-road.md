I am really pleased :relaxed: to share the news that my proposal got accepted in **Google Summer of Code-2020** under [The JuliaLang Organization](https://julialang.org/).

It was all started at the end of December. I was in my kitchen making coffee. :coffee:

I phoned my friend [Nikhil shah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iamshnik/) and while discussing with him, he told me to apply for GSoC. I had some decent experience in coding, and was interested in Natural language processing. After thinking for a while I decided to give it a shot and started taking advice from previous GSoCer. [Ayush](https://ayushk4.github.io/) was one of them. He helped me with getting started . After going through lot of the organization I decided to apply in [JuliaText](https://github.com/JuliaText) (It is the JuliaLang organization that provides with packages to work with text). 

I started going through offical documentation of Julia which is one of the best getting-started guide I have ever seen. It was well written and simple enough for people even from non-coding background to get started. Afterward I made my first PR on 22nd of December 2019 though it was oneliner. I kept adding and fixing Documentation in different repositories of JuliaText. Soon enough I started adding feature and also wrote the GoogleDrive.jl(Package to automate google drive download) in julia. I also made alot of other contribution in different repositories of julia until the end of the March. 

On 15 march, I started working on my proposal. It was difficult, but the most intersting part for me. I went though alot of research paper in the field of Natural language Processing.
Finally On march 28, I drafted and submitted my final porposal for JuliaText.

After all these hardwork and a complete month of mixed emotions, full of nervousness and excitement. Finally the day of judgement came. On may 4, at 11:31 IST I went to google summer of code site and searched for my name and voil√†! it was there.

I would like to thank my mentors [Aviks](https://github.com/aviks/) & [Ayushk4](https://ayushk4.github.io/) for selecting me as student developer in Google summer of code. It would not have been possible without your support and the wonderful Julia community. 

**Here is the list of major thing i will be working on:**

- **[ALBERT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11942.pdf)** - Implementing Framework for ALBERT with easy access APIs to users
- **Language model Interface** - consisting of different Language model such as interpolated language models, MLE ngram model etc. inspired from [nltk.lm](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.lm.html). 

Looking forward to a great time in the upcoming summers!

**Special acknowledgement**

[Lakshya sharma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lakshya-sharma-5079/) and [Nikhil shah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iamshnik/): Thank you for supporting me throughout and listening to all my tantrums all along.
